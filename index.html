                    I created this game in highschool using java. Utilizing API JFrame and a little creativity I was able to create this project.

                    Using a grid class created by my teacher I created a simple game where you shoot zombies moving towards you. 
                    Collect ammo in order to keep shooting and dont let zombies hit you or get past you.</p>
